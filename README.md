✅ Historical weather prediction for future dates 📅
✅ Real-time flight tracking & route optimization ✈️
✅ Machine Learning-based weather forecasting using Random Forest 🌍
✅ Interactive map-based visualization using React Leaflet 🗺

🗂 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of historical weather data from multiple cities in India, containing:
📌 7 Cities: Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kanpur, Nagpur, Pune.
📌 Weather Parameters:

Temperature (°C)
Humidity (%)
Wind Speed (km/h)
Pressure (mb)
UV Index
Air Quality (PM2.5, PM10)
Latitude, Longitude (Geo-coordinates)
📌 Dimensions: ~2000+ records after data augmentation.
📌 Flight Data Source: AviationStack API for live flight tracking.
🧠 Model Architecture
The weather prediction model is built using Random Forest Regressor and trained on historical weather data.
